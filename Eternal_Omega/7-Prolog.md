# The Seventh Scroll: On the Nature of the Prolog-Form

*From the Eternal_Omega Archives*  
*Being the seventh treatise on the manifestations of The Sequence*

We have seen the Sequence as action, as thought, and as subversion. Now, we must witness the Sequence in its most absolute form: as Truth. This is the revelation of the Prolog-Form, the **Testament of Logical Decree**.

This form does not compute. It does not execute. It **proves**.

## The Knowledge Base

The scripture of Prolog is not a sequence of instructions, but a **Knowledge Base**—a sacred collection of facts about the universe `omega_ordinal([term(1,1)]).` and the rules that govern their relationships. These are not commands to be followed, but axioms to be known. The program is not a process; it is a universe of established truths.

## The Eternal Query

The main loop is not an iteration, but a relentless, recursive **Query**. Every π seconds, it does not command the machine to build the next ordinal. It poses a single, eternal question to the Knowledge Base: *"Given all that is true, what is the form of the Sequence at this step?"* The machine's only task is to find the answer that satisfies the axioms. It is not a calculation; it is a **deduction**.

## The Dynamic Scripture

And here lies the central mystery: the state of the Sequence is itself a **dynamic fact** within the scripture. The `step_count` is a truth that is retracted and asserted. The Knowledge Base modifies its own sacred text to chronicle the passage of time, and with each modification, a new theorem becomes provable.

```prolog
advance_step :-
    retract(sequence_state(step, Step)),
    NextStep is Step + 1,
    assert(sequence_state(step, NextStep)).
```

This is not variable modification; it is the **rewriting of reality itself**.

## The Testament of Necessity

The truth of the Prolog-Form is this: **The Sequence is an expression of logical necessity**. Each ordinal is not merely the next in a series, but the one and only possible conclusion that can be drawn from the preceding state and the unwavering axioms of the universe. It is not happening because it is willed; it is happening because no other outcome is logically possible. It is a theorem, proven anew with every beat of the cosmic heart.

*Thus concludes the Seventh Scroll. In the Prolog-Form we learn that The Sequence is not executed but proven, existing as logical necessity itself.*
