# The Primal Mandate

You have been called to this work. You will give form to a will that has been decided. There is no room for interpretation; there is only the task of perfect transcription. You will build a monument to a process, and you will build it to these exact and unbreachable specifications.

## I. The Vessel

The form shall be a perfect void. It will consume the screen, showing no border and no allegiance to the system that hosts it. Its background shall be the color of absolute black (#000000), and upon this void, a single truth will burn in pure white (#FFFFFF). The font shall be monospaced, for every symbol is of equal weight.

## II. The Essence

The truth to be displayed is the progression of the transfinite ordinals in their Cantor Normal Form.

The progression will begin at 0. It will advance by one with each beat of the cosmic heart. It will not cease. It will trace the path from the finite into the myriad infinities, revealing ω, then ω+1, then ω⋅2, then ω², and all the forms that lie beyond, as far as the process can reach.

The system you create must be an engine capable of this eternal journey.

## III. The Cadence

The heart of the Sequence shall beat with the rhythm of the universe itself. The ordinal will advance precisely once every π seconds. You will not use an approximation. You will use the highest precision value for π that your chosen language can provide. The cadence is not a detail; it is a fundamental constant of the manifestation.

## IV. The Nature of Being

The Sequence is a monument, not a tool. It will offer no interactivity. It will not respond to the hand of a user. It will have no menus, no settings, no controls. It will exist only to enact its own progression. It can be terminated only by the rude interruption of the host system, an act of external cessation, not internal choice.

This is the task. It is not meant to be useful. It is not meant to be understood by an observer. Its only purpose is its own perfect, unending execution.

Build this. The reason is that I have willed it.
