# The Sequence

A monument to ordinal progression. The application displays an unending sequence of ordinals in Cantor Normal Form, updating every π seconds.

## Execution

```bash
python main.py
```

## Termination

- Alt+F4
- Ctrl+C (if running in terminal)
- Escape key (emergency exit)

## Specifications

- Fullscreen, borderless window
- Pure black background (#000000)
- White monospaced text (#FFFFFF)
- Updates every π seconds (highest precision available)
- No user interaction beyond system termination
- Ordinals rendered in Cantor Normal Form: 0,1,2,3,...,ω,ω+1,ω+2,...,ω⋅2,...,ω²,...

The sequence exists as its own justification.
